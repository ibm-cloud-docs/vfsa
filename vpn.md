# Working with VPN
{: #working-with-vpn}

This topic details a sample configuration for a route-based VPN between two sites. In this sample configuration Server 1 (Site A) can communicate with Server 2 (Site B), and each site utilizes two phase IPSEC authentication.

## Performance consideration
{: #performance-consideration}

To achieve the best IPSEC VPN performance, use AES-GCM as the encryption algorithm for both IKE and IPSEC proposals.

For example:

```sh
set security ike proposal IKE-PROP encryption-algorithm aes-128-gcm
set security ipsec proposal IPSEC-PROP encryption-algorithm aes-128-gcm
```

With AES-GCM as the encryption algorithm, you don't need to specify the authentication algorithm in the same proposal. AES-GCM provides both encryption and authentication.

## Additional VPN configurations

To configure IPSec VPN, site to site, remote access VPN, and other features, refer to this [configuration guide](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/information-products/pathway-pages/security/security-vpn-ipsec.pdf){: external} from Juniper.

For an example of how to configure a route-based site to site IPSec VPN, refer to this [configuration guide](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/example/ipsec-route-based-vpn-configuring.html){: external} from Juniper.
